TODO: Add README.md

This repository contains an implementation to track papers of interest and to run scheduled updates to pull from arXiv and AI conferences any papers that contain tracked keywords of interest.

Immediate desire is to track NeuroAI papers. As I'm working out the strategy to develop the best API and RAG strategy, I will update the README when I'm happy with the project.
